# YTDownloader

YTDownloader is a software made in Python by yours truly to help make downloading videos off Youtube a lot easier

It's tiresome to have to click through 20 malware sites and ads just to download one piece of music off Youtube.
Which is why, using Customtkinter and PyTube, I created a free, open-source piece of software that downloads any YouTube video as an MP3 or MP4 file.

Before using the software, make sure you have Python installed and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal otherwise the software won't work.

To use YTDownloader, simple just run it and and paste in a URL using CTRL+C and CTRL+V, then specify whether you want to download it as an MP3 or MP4 file and the path you want to install to.
